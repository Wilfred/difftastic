Thanks for reporting a bug! Please include all of the following:

(1) A description of the issue. A screenshot is often helpful too.

(2) A copy of what you're diffing. If you're diffing files, include the before and after files. If you're using difftastic with a VCS repository (e.g. git), include the URL and commit hash.

(3) The version of difftastic you're using (see `difft --version`) and your operating system.
