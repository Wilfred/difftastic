# Goal: support at least 12 months of Rust versions, and be
# conservative about upgrades to help packagers.
#
# https://releases.rs/ is a useful website to see when different Rust
# versions were released.
#
# For reference, Debian stable is on 1.85 (see
# https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rustc) but Debian doesn't currently
# package difftastic. Other distros are somewhat newer.
