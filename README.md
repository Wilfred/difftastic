# tree-sitter-hack

[Hack](https://hacklang.org/) grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

# Workflow

**`bin/generate-parser`**

Wrapper around `tree-sitter generate` that skips parser generation if `grammar.js` hasn't changed since last run.

**`bin/generate-corpus`**

Unlike most other Tree-sitter projects, we breakout test cases into separate files (see`test/cases`). This is mostly done so editors have an easier time syntax highlighting our test cases but also I find individual files easier to navigate than the `corpus.txt` files used by Tree-sitter.

We use `bin/generate-corpus` to generate the `test/corpus/case1.txt` from individual `test/cases` files so we can still use `tree-sitter test`.

**`bin/test-corpus`**

Run `bin/generate-corpus` and `bin/generate-parser` before running `tree-sitter test`.
