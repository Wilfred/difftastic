# tree-sitter-hack

[Hack](https://hacklang.org/) grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). Very much ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/antoniodejesusochoasolano/tree-sitter-hack
$ cd tree-sitter-hack
$ npm install
$ echo 'function main(): void { print "wyd, world\\n"; }' > script.hack
$ node_modules/.bin/tree-sitter generate
$ node_modules/.bin/tree-sitter parse script.hack
(script [0, 0] - [3, 0]
  (function_declaration [0, 0] - [2, 1]
    name: (identifier [0, 9] - [0, 13])
    (parameters [0, 13] - [0, 15])
    return_type: (primitive_type [0, 17] - [0, 21])
    body: (compound_statement [0, 22] - [2, 1]
      (expression_statement [1, 2] - [1, 23]
        (print_expression [1, 2] - [1, 22]
          (string [1, 8] - [1, 22]))))))
```

## Note

- I'm using HHVM 4.62 because it's the [last version](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/747d13f9a65401a3193efeecfd548d8166afebcc) to include the s-expression CST output and I'm using `hh_parse --full-fidelity-s-expression` as a guide for writing `grammar.js`.

- `<?hh` is optional in this grammar unlike standard Hack. The Hack parser requires an `<?hh` tag at the top of `.php` files. Does it really matter?

- `src/` is not commited to the repository. Do we need to? Can't Tree-sitter generate the parser from `grammar.js`?

## Questions

### Inline vs hidden

`$._rule` vs `inline: [$._rule]` vs `inline: [$.rule]`

- What's the difference between hidden rules and inline rules?
- If a rule is inline, does it really have to be hidden?

### Inline vs helper function

- What's the difference between an inline rule and using a helper function?
- Is there performance benefits from naming rules even though they're removed from the grammar?
- What does it mean for the rule to be removed from the grammar?

For example, I see `$._variablish` is present in `src/grammar.json`. What does this mean?

### Alias vs inline vs hidden

- `alias($._rule, $.alias)` - Is `$.alias` hidden?
- `alias($.rule, $._alias)` - I'm assuming `$._alias` is hidden?
- `inline: [$._rule]` - Is alias inline?

## Scripts

**`bin/generate-parser`**

Wrapper around `tree-sitter generate` that skips parser generation if `grammar.js` hasn't changed since last run.

**`bin/generate-corpus`**

Unlike most other Tree-sitter projects, we breakout test cases into separate files (see [`test/cases`](https://github.com/antoniodejesusochoasolano/tree-sitter-hack/tree/main/test/cases)). This is done so editors have an easier time syntax highlighting test cases. But also I find individual files easier to navigate than the `corpus.txt` files used by Tree-sitter.

We use `bin/generate-corpus` to generate the `test/corpus/case1.txt` from individual `test/cases` files so we can still use `tree-sitter test`.

**`bin/test-corpus`**

Run `bin/generate-corpus` and `bin/generate-parser` before running `tree-sitter test`.
