=================

A [tree-sitter] grammar for the [Gleam programming language]

[tree-sitter]: http://tree-sitter.github.io
[Gleam programming language]: https://gleam.run

This is, presently, very much a work-in-progress as only `import` and `const` (kinda) statements are supported.

## TODO

- [ ] Rework constant statements (give them the same limitations that the Gleam parser does)
- [ ] Type statements
- [ ] Function statements
- [ ] Syntax highlighting queries
