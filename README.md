## CPP

Preprocessor `#elif` and `#else` directives cannot be handled correctly, since the parser state would have to be
manually reset to what it was at the `#if`.
As a workaround, the code blocks in the alternative branches are parsed as part of the directives.

## Layout

`NondecreasingIndentation` is not supported (yet?).

### Operators on newlines in `do`

A strange edge case is when an infix operator follows an expression statement of a do block with an indent of less or equal the `do`'s layout column:

```haskell
f = do
  readSomething
  >>= doSomething
```

The `>>=` causes the `do`'s layout to be terminated, resulting in an AST similar to

```haskell
f = (do readSomething) >>= doSomething
```

This is checked heuristically, probably unreliably.
