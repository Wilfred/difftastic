D Grammar for Tree Sitter

This is a new start at a D grammar for Tree Sitter.

This supports a subset of the grammar, and may be of some use while it
is still in development.

I'm working on extending this to support the grammar documented on dlang.org.

D is an incredibly complex (some might say too much so) language, and I'm still learning
it.  So it's likely that there are bugs here in the grammar, and this also explains at
some level the non-trivial amount of time this has taken (is taking) me.

My hope is to actually complete this work soon, because a number of popular tools
will become either functional, or more functional, when a proper grammar is provided for.

I do welcome feedback, with the caveat that I'm new to Tree Sitter, and to D, and I'm
not really a JavaScript or Scheme programmer (I've barely touched them before this).
Please bear that in mind as you throw sticks, stones, and Molotov cocktails in my
general direction.
