        **Before** reporting an issue, make sure to search [existing issues](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-css/issues). Usage questions such as ***"How do I...?"*** either belong in [Discussions](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions) upstream or in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/w7nTvsVJhm) and will be closed.
        If your issue is related to a bug in your editor-experience because your editor *leverages* tree-sitter and this parser, then it is likely your issue does *NOT* belong here and belongs in the relevant editor's repository.
