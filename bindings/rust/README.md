# tree-sitter-ruby

This crate provides a Ruby grammar for the [tree-sitter][] parsing library.
To use this crate, add it to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`
file.  (Note that you will probably also need to depend on the
[`tree-sitter`][tree-sitter crate] crate to use the parsed result in any useful
way.)

``` toml
[dependencies]
tree-sitter = "0.17"
tree-sitter-ruby = "0.16"
```

Typically, you will use the [language][language func] function to add this
grammar to a tree-sitter [Parser][], and then use the parser to parse some code:

``` rust
let code = r#"
    def double(x)
      x * 2
    end
"#;
let mut parser = Parser::new();
parser.set_language(tree_sitter_ruby::language()).expect("Error loading Ruby grammar");
let parsed = parser.parse(code, None);
```

discussions] page.
