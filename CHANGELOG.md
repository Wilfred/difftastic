Diffs are now displayed with unchanged lines aligned to the other side.

Improved Rust parsing to recognise lifetime syntax `'foo`, character
literals `'x'` and sequences of punctuation.

Improve punctuation parsing for OCaml and JS.

Fixed an issue where the diff calculated may not be minimal.

## 0.2

First version using Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating diffs.

## 0.1

Experimenting with different implementation ideas.
