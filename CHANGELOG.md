## 0.6 (unreleased)

### Parsing

Fixed handling of `<` and `>` in elisp.

### Diffing

Fixed an issue where comment replacements were not detected.

### Command Line Interface

Removed unused `--inline` argument.

## 0.5

### Parsing

Fixed a crash on parsing non-ASCII source files. Fixed a crash on
files without an extension. Fixed crashes on empty files.

Input files that aren't valid UTF-8 are now replaced with ï¿½ rather
than giving up.

Improved parsing for Rust punctuation.

Improved parsing for OCaml punctuation, including `:=` and `method!`.

Improved parsing for Emacs Lisp symbols containing `+` and `=`, and
punctuation of `#`, `.` and `&`.

Improved parsing for Scheme symbols containing `=`, and punctuation of
`#` and `.`.

Improved parsing of `=` and `&` in Clojure.

Improved parsing of `:`, `,`, and constants in JSON.

Improved parsing of string literals in all languages, supporting
escaped delimiters such as `"\""` and removing incorrect support for
single-quoted strings in JSON.

### Diffing

Reduced memory usage when diffing.

Difftastic now highlights word-level changes between comments.

Diffing now prefers contiguous nodes even when entering a list, so
`(foo` is considered contiguous.

Large AST trees with very few common nodes are now considered wholly
novel, rather than trying to match up the few common nodes. This
avoids nonsensical diffs when toplevel function A is completely
replaced with function B and they only have something trivial in
common (e.g. the `function` keyword).

### Command Line Interface

Improved `--help`.

### Integration

It's now possible to use `difftastic` with `git diff` and `git show`!

## 0.4

### Parsing

Improved parsing for Rust macro definitions and punctuation.

Improved parsing for OCaml punctuation, and added `.mli` as an OCaml
file extension.

### Diffing

Diff calculation is now significantly faster.

Difftastic now considers nesting depth when comparing AST nodes, and
tries to match nodes with similar nesting levels.

Difftastic now prefers marking multiple items on the same line as
novel, rather than adjacent items on different lines. This helps avoid
[sliders](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1411949035871637509),
where the diff chooses a keyword on the 'wrong' side.

Fixed an issue where complex diffs would not display some unchanged
lines.

### Robustness

Fixed a crash when diff context included the first line.

Fixed a crash when plain text content contained certain non-ASCII
characters.

## 0.3

Diffs are now displayed with unchanged lines aligned to the other side.

Improved Rust parsing to recognise lifetime syntax `'foo`, character
literals `'x'` and punctuation.

Improved punctuation parsing for OCaml and JS.

Fixed an issue where the diff calculated may not be minimal.

Fixed a crash on files with no changes.

## 0.2

First version using Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating diffs.

## 0.1

Experimenting with different implementation ideas.
