## Acknowledgements

While this parser is written from scratch, there were previous efforts that made
for a helpful reference:

* [tree-sitter-elixir](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tree-sitter-elixir) developed
  by [@ananthakumaran](https://github.com/ananthakumaran)
* [tree-sitter-elixir](https://github.com/wingyplus/tree-sitter-elixir) developed
  by [@wingyplus](https://github.com/wingyplus) and [@Tuxified](https://github.com/Tuxified)

In particular, some test cases were sourced from [ananthakumaran/tree-sitter-elixir](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tree-sitter-elixir).
