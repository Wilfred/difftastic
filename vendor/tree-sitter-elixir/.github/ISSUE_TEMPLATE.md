<!--
This repository includes the Tree-sitter parser for Elixir,
whereas editor-specific integrations are separate projects.

If you're running into Tree-sitter related issues in your editor,
please report it on the respective repository (likely an editor
plugin responsible for Tree-sitter integration).

For example, when using Neovim, go to https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter
