tree-sitter-gleam
=================

A [tree-sitter] grammar for the [Gleam programming language]

[tree-sitter]: https://tree-sitter.github.io
[Gleam programming language]: https://gleam.run

This grammar is able to parse the entire Gleam language. It is largely based
on the Gleam parser itself, and deviations from that are noted throughout the
codebase.

Usage
-----

tree-sitter-gleam, as with all tree-sitter grammars, is of limited utility on
its own. Instead, tree-sitter-gleam is best used as a Gleam parser that can be
embedded in other projects. An example of such a project is
[tree-sitter-gleam-rust-example].

However, [tree-sitter-cli] can be used with this grammar to show generated parse
trees and syntax highlighting for a given Gleam file.

1. [Install tree-sitter-cli]
2. Create a `tree-sitters` directory in your home directory.
3. Clone this repository (or symlink it) into the new `~/tree-sitters/` directory.
4. Run `tree-sitter parse path/to/file.gleam` to be shown the parse tree for the
   file.
5. Run `tree-sitter highlight path/to/file.gleam` to be shown the file with
   syntax highlighting applied.

Various Gotchas
---------------

There are a few nodes in the generated AST that may be confusing at first:
- `type` :: A very ambiguous name, but this refers to a concrete type such as
  `List(#(String, Int))`
- `type_name` :: Refers to essentially the left side of a type declaration and
  includes parameters, e.g. `MyType(foo, bar)`.
- `type_identifier` :: Known in the parser as "UpName", this is what you would
  intuitively think of as a type's name, such as `List` or `Result`.
- `function_call` :: The name is not confusing, but its structure may be. Since
  Gleam supports first-class functions, the function being invoked could be a
  variable, a field of a record, an element of a tuple, etc. Some of these are
  ambiguous without context that tree-sitter does not have. e.g.
  In `string.replace(x, y, z)`, `string` could be a record with a field
  `replace` that is a function or it could be a module with a function `replace`
  ‚Äîthere's no way for the parser to know. In this case, it will be parsed to
  `(function_call function: (field_access ...) ...)` , as I arbitrarily decided
  to always assume the code is accessing a field on a record.

This is not a comprehensive list. If you find a node confusing, search for it
in `grammar.js`, as it might have an explanatory comment. Either way, feel free
to add it to this list and send a PR! ‚ú®

Style
-----

To prevent headaches from stylistic differences, I request that you please
follow these style suggestions. üôè

- Remove all non-mandatory trailing whitespace
- Ensure a final newline is present at the end of all files (this is the default
  in Vim, Emacs)
- Format JavaScript by running `npm run format`
