# Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Specifically, if you found a bug or have a
suggestion for a new feature or markdown extension, you can always open an
[issue] or [pull request].

## Issues

If you open an issue please give a short description of your bug or feature
along with a code example. If there is a relevant spec like the [CommonMark
Spec][commonmark] or the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec][gfm] please link it in
the issue.

Any feature suggestions are welcome. The grammar should by default only support
very common syntax, but any extension can be implemented behind a compile time
flag. (See below)

Some bug reports belong in other repositories if they only concern the
implementation of the grammar in a specific context like `nvim-treesitter`, but
you can always open an issue here and I will point you in the right direction.

## Code Overview

Please refer to the [tree-sitter spec] for more details on how to write a tree-
sitter grammar.

This parse is split into two grammars. One for block structure, which can be
found in the `tree-sitter-markdown` folder, and one for inline structure, which
can be found in the `tree-sitter-markdown-inline` folder. Components that are
parts of either grammar can be found in the `common` folder.

For either of the grammar the most important files are the `grammar.js` which
defines most nodes and the `src/scanner.cc` which defines nodes that cannot
be parsed with normal tree-sitter rules. All other files in the `src` subfolder
are auto-generated by running `tree-sitter generate --no-bindings`. (You need to
install the [tree-sitter cli tool][tree-sitter-cli] first.)

Some syntactical components can be enabled or disabled by environment variables
at compile time. The logic for this can be found in the `common/grammar.js`
file.

Tests are located in the `corpus` subfolder:
* `spec.txt` is taken from the examples in the [GFM spec][gfm].
* `failing.txt` are those examples from the spec that do not pass yet.
* `issues.txt` are test cases covering solved issues.
* `extension_<>.txt` are covering specific extensions. Some of these are also
  taken from the GFM spec.

## Pull Requests

I will happily accept any pull requests.

Before submitting any code please check the following:

* You ran `tree-sitter generate --no-bindings` in the `tree-sitter-markdown` or
  `tree-sitter-markdown-inline` directories respecively after modifying any
  `grammar.js` file.
* When running `tree-sitter test` only the cases defined in `failing.txt` or
  `extension_<>.txt` for not activated extensions fail for **both** gramars.
* If you implemented new behavior please add tests. (In most cases these belong
  in a `extension_<>.txt`.)
* You deleted any auto-generated bindings and files for debugging purposes
  like `log.html`
