1. Increase the version number in the package.json
2. Push the code to master
3. Run `npm publish`
4. Create a release on github with the name being the version number from before prefixed with `v` for e.g. `v1.1.0`
5. Enjoy, builds should appear on that release as soon as the CI is done running them.
