You will need the rust toolchain. You can get it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Cargo Installation

You can install the binary directly from cargo:

```
$ cargo install difftastic
```

To compile from source, clone the repo and then run:

```
$ cargo build
```

Then to install (by default to `$HOME/.cargo/bin`):

```

```

Or simply use with:

```
$ cargo run
```
