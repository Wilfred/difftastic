<p>Unix signals are inherently hard to handle correctly, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are a global resource. If a library wants to set its own signal handlers, it risks
disrupting some other library. It is possible to chain the previous signal handler, but then
it is impossible to remove the old signal handlers from the chains in any practical manner.</li>
<li>They can be called from whatever thread, requiring synchronization. Also, as they can
interrupt a thread at any time, making most handling race-prone.</li>
<li>According to the POSIX standard, the set of functions one may call inside a signal handler is
limited to very few of them. To highlight, mutexes (or other locking mechanisms) and memory
allocation and deallocation is <em>not</em> allowed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-goal-of-the-library"><a href="#the-goal-of-the-library">The goal of the library</a></h2>
<p>The aim is to subscriptions to signals a „structured“ resource, in a similar way memory
allocation is ‒ parts of the program can independently subscribe and it’s the same part of the
program that can give them up, independently of what the other parts do. Therefore, it is
possible to register multiple actions to the same signal.</p>
<p>Another goal is to shield applications away from differences between platforms. Various Unix
systems have little quirks and differences that need to be worked around and that’s not
something every application should be dealing with. We even try to provide some support for
Windows, but we lack the expertise in that area, so that one is not complete and is a bit rough
(if you know how it works there and are willing to either contribute the code or consult,
please get in touch).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it provides implementation of certain common signal-handling patterns, usable from
safe Rust, without the application author needing to learn about <em>all</em> the traps.</p>
<p>Note that despite everything, there are still some quirks around signal handling that are not
possible to paper over and need to be considered. Also, there are some signal use cases that
are inherently unsafe and they are not covered by this crate.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-the-crate"><a href="#anatomy-of-the-crate">Anatomy of the crate</a></h2>
<p>The crate is split into several modules.</p>
<p>The easiest way to handle signals is using the <a href="iterator/type.Signals.html" title="type signal_hook::iterator::Signals"><code>Signals</code></a> iterator
thing. It can register for a set of signals and produce them one by one, in a blocking manner.
You can reserve a thread for handling them as they come. If you want something asynchronous,
there are adaptor crates for the most common asynchronous runtimes. The module also contains
ways to build iterators that produce a bit more information that just the signal number.</p>
<p>The <a href="flag/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::flag"><code>flag</code></a> module contains routines to set a flag based on incoming signals and to do
certain actions inside the signal handlers based on the flags (the flags can also be
manipulated by the rest of the application). This allows building things like checking if a
signal happened on each loop iteration or making sure application shuts down on the second
CTRL+C if it got stuck in graceful shutdown requested by the first.</p>
<p>The <a href="consts/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::consts"><code>consts</code></a> module contains some constants, most importantly the signal numbers themselves
(these are just re-exports from <a href="../libc/index.html" title="mod libc"><code>libc</code></a> and if your OS has some extra ones, you can use them
too, this is just for convenience).</p>
<p>And last, there is the <a href="low_level/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::low_level"><code>low_level</code></a> module. It contains routines to directly register and
unregister arbitrary actions. Some of the patters in the above modules return a <a href="struct.SigId.html" title="struct signal_hook::SigId"><code>SigId</code></a>,
which can be used with the <a href="low_level/fn.unregister.html" title="fn signal_hook::low_level::unregister"><code>low_level::unregister</code></a> to remove the action. There are also some
other utilities that are more suited to build other abstractions with than to use directly.</p>
<p>Certain parts of the library can be enabled or disabled with use flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>channel</code>: The <a href="low_level/channel/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::low_level::channel">low_level::channel</a> module (on by default).</li>
<li><code>iterator</code>: The <a href="iterator/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::iterator">iterator</a> module (on by default).</li>
<li><code>extended-sig-info</code>: Support for providing more information in the iterators or from the
async adaptor crates. This is off by default.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations"><a href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>OS limitations still apply. Certain signals are not possible to override or subscribe to ‒
<code>SIGKILL</code> or <code>SIGSTOP</code>.</li>
<li>Overriding some others is probably a very stupid idea (or very unusual needs) ‒ handling eg.
<code>SIGSEGV</code> is not something done lightly. For that reason, the crate will panic in case
registering of these is attempted (see <a href="consts/constant.FORBIDDEN.html" title="constant signal_hook::consts::FORBIDDEN"><code>FORBIDDEN</code></a>. If you still
need to do so, you can find such APIs in the <code>signal-hook-registry</code> backend crate, but
additional care must be taken.</li>
<li>Interaction with other signal-handling libraries is limited. If signal-hook finds an existing
handler present, it chain-calls it from the signal it installs and assumes other libraries
would do the same, but that’s everything that can be done to make it work with libraries not
based on <a href="https://lib.rs/signal-hook-registry"><code>signal-hook-registry</code></a>
(the backend of this crate).</li>
<li>The above chaining contains a race condition in multi-threaded programs, where the previous
handler might not get called if it is received during the registration process. This is
handled (at least on non-windows platforms) on the same thread where the registration
happens, therefore it is advised to register at least one action for each signal of interest
early, before any additional threads are started. Registering any additional (or removing and
registering again) action on the same signal is without the race condition.</li>
<li>Once at least one action is registered for a signal, the default action is replaced (this is
how signals work in the OS). Even if all actions of that signal are removed, <code>signal-hook</code>
does not restore the default handler (such behaviour would be at times inconsistent with
making the actions independent and there’s no reasonable way to do so in a race-free way in a
multi-threaded program while also dealing with signal handlers registered with other
libraries). It is, however, possible to <em>emulate</em> the default handler (see the
<a href="low_level/fn.emulate_default_handler.html" title="fn signal_hook::low_level::emulate_default_handler"><code>emulate_default_handler</code></a>) ‒ there are only 4
default handlers:
<ul>
<li>Ignore. This is easy to emulate.</li>
<li>Abort. Depending on if you call it from within a signal handler of from outside, the
<a href="low_level/fn.abort.html" title="fn signal_hook::low_level::abort"><code>low_level::abort</code></a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/process/fn.abort.html" title="fn std::process::abort"><code>std::process::abort</code></a> can be used.</li>
<li>Terminate. This can be done with <code>exit</code> (<a href="low_level/fn.exit.html" title="fn signal_hook::low_level::exit"><code>low_level::exit</code></a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/process/fn.exit.html" title="fn std::process::exit"><code>std::process::exit</code></a>).</li>
<li>Stop. It is possible to <a href="low_level/fn.raise.html" title="fn signal_hook::low_level::raise"><code>raise</code></a> the <a href="consts/signal/constant.SIGSTOP.html" title="constant signal_hook::consts::signal::SIGSTOP"><code>SIGSTOP</code></a> signal.
That one can’t be replaced and always stops the application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many of the patterns here can collate multiple instances of the same signal into fewer
instances, if the application doesn’t consume them fast enough. This is consistent with what
the kernel does if the application doesn’t keep up with them (at least for non-realtime
signals, see below), so it is something one needs to deal with anyway.</li>
<li>(By design) the library mostly <em>postpones</em> or helps the user postpone acting on the signals
until later. This, in combination with the above collating inside the library may make it
unsuitable for realtime signals. These usually want to be handled directly inside the signal
handler ‒ which still can be done with <a href="low_level/fn.register.html" title="fn signal_hook::low_level::register">signal_hook_registry::register</a>, but using unsafe and
due care. Patterns for working safely with realtime signals are not unwanted in the library,
but nobody contributed them yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signal-masks"><a href="#signal-masks">Signal masks</a></h2>
<p>As the library uses <code>sigaction</code> under the hood, signal masking works as expected (eg. with
<code>pthread_sigmask</code>). This means, signals will <em>not</em> be delivered if the signal is masked in all
program’s threads.</p>
<p>By the way, if you do want to modify the signal mask (or do other Unix-specific magic), the
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/nix">nix</a> crate offers safe interface to many low-level functions,
including
<a href="https://docs.rs/nix/0.11.0/nix/sys/signal/fn.pthread_sigmask.html"><code>pthread_sigmask</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="portability"><a href="#portability">Portability</a></h2>
<p>It should work on any POSIX.1-2001 system, which are all the major big OSes with the notable
exception of Windows.</p>
<p>Non-standard signals are also supported. Pass the signal value directly from <code>libc</code> or use
the numeric value directly.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">use </span>std::sync::Arc;
<span class="kw">use </span>std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool};
<span class="kw">let </span>term = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(<span class="bool-val">false</span>));
<span class="kw">let _ </span>= signal_hook::flag::register(libc::SIGINT, Arc::clone(<span class="kw-2">&amp;</span>term));</code></pre></div>
<p>This crate includes a limited support for Windows, based on <code>signal</code>/<code>raise</code> in the CRT.
There are differences in both API and behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many parts of the library are not available there.</li>
<li>We have only a few signals: <code>SIGABRT</code>, <code>SIGABRT_COMPAT</code>, <code>SIGBREAK</code>,
<code>SIGFPE</code>, <code>SIGILL</code>, <code>SIGINT</code>, <code>SIGSEGV</code> and <code>SIGTERM</code>.</li>
<li>Due to lack of signal blocking, there’s a race condition.
After the call to <code>signal</code>, there’s a moment where we miss a signal.
That means when you register a handler, there may be a signal which invokes
neither the default handler or the handler you register.</li>
<li>Handlers registered by <code>signal</code> in Windows are cleared on first signal.
To match behavior in other platforms, we re-register the handler each time the handler is
called, but there’s a moment where we miss a handler.
That means when you receive two signals in a row, there may be a signal which invokes
the default handler, nevertheless you certainly have registered the handler.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, signals won’t work as you expected. <code>SIGTERM</code> isn’t actually used and
not all <code>Ctrl-C</code>s are turned into <code>SIGINT</code>.</p>
<p>Patches to improve Windows support in this library are welcome.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<p>There are several feature flags that control how much is available as part of the crate, some
enabled by default.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>channel</code>: (enabled by default) The <a href="low_level/channel/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::low_level::channel">Channel</a> synchronization
primitive for exporting data out of signal handlers.</li>
<li><code>iterator</code>: (enabled by default) An <a href="iterator/type.Signals.html" title="type signal_hook::iterator::Signals">Signals iterator</a> that
provides a convenient interface for receiving signals in rust-friendly way.</li>
<li><code>extended-siginfo</code> adds support for providing extra information as part of the iterator
interface.</li>

<p>Feel free to open a pull requests if you want to add support for runtimes not mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="porting-from-previous-versions"><a href="#porting-from-previous-versions">Porting from previous versions</a></h2>
<p>There were some noisy changes when going from 0.2 version to the 0.3 version. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of things moved around to make the structure of the crate a bit more understandable.
Most of the time it should be possible to just search the documentation for the name that
can’t be resolved to discover the new location.
<ul>
<li>The signal constants (<code>SIGTERM</code>, for example) are in <a href="consts/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::consts"><code>consts</code></a> submodule (individual
imports) and in the <a href="consts/signal/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::consts::signal"><code>consts::signal</code></a> (for wildcard import of all of them).</li>
<li>Some APIs that are considered more of a low-level building blocks than for casual day to
day use are now in the <a href="low_level/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::low_level"><code>low_level</code></a> submodule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The previous version contained the <code>cleanup</code> module that allowed for removal of the actions
in rather destructive way (nuking actions of arbitrary other parts of the program). This is
completely gone in this version. The use case of shutting down the application on second
CTRL+C is now supported by a pattern described in the <a href="flag/index.html" title="mod signal_hook::flag"><code>flag</code></a> submodule. For other similar
