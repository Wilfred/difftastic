// This file exists to flag to the `tree-sitter` CLI that we are a proper grammar directory, to work
// around some inflexibility in the CLI. However, it will get replaced at install-time with totally
// different contents. Do not check in these changes!

// You can ignore this file's changes using `git update-index --skip-worktree grammar.js`.
